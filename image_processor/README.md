# Image Processor

[Project Page](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/755)

## Description
- For this project, I created an image processing console application that takes a list of images and creates new images from them based on the method:
    - Inverse:
        - inverts an image’s color.
    - Grayscale:
        - converts each image to grayscale.
    - BlackWhite:
        - reduces each image to only black and white values, based on a given threshold.
    - Thumbnail:
        - creates a thumbnail image based on a given height (in pixels).
