# 0x08. C# - Inheritance
- [Project Page](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/419)

## Learning Objectives
- What is inheritance
- How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
- What is a base class
- What is a derived class
- How to create a derived class
- How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
- What is the difference between the override and new modifiers
- What are is, .GetType(), TypeOf(), .IsInstanceOfType(), and .IsSubclassOf() and when to use them

## Task Descriptions
- 0-is/, 0-is/0-is.csproj, 0-is/0-is.cs : Method that returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False.
- 1-instance/, 1-instance/1-instance.csproj, 1-instance/1-instance.cs : Method that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, Array, otherwise return False.
- 2-subclass/, 2-subclass/2-subclass.csproj, 2-subclass/2-subclass.cs : Method that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise return False. The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return True if the object is an instance of the base class.
- 3-type_get/, 3-type_get/3-type_get.csproj, 3-type_get/3-type_get.cs : Method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object
- 4-inherit/, 4-inherit/4-inherit.cs, 4-inherit/4-inherit.csproj : Create empty class Dog that inherits from empty class Animal.
- 5-shape/, 5-shape/5-shape.csproj, 5-shape/5-shape.cs : Create a class Shape.
- 6-shape/, 6-shape/6-shape.csproj, 6-shape/6-shape.cs : Based on 5-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape.
- 7-shape/, 7-shape/7-shape.csproj, 7-shape/7-shape.cs : Based on 6-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape.
- 8-shape/, 8-shape/8-shape.csproj, 8-shape/8-shape.cs : Based on 7-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle
- 9-shape/, 9-shape/9-shape.csproj, 9-shape/9-shape.cs : Based on 8-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle
- Write an aritcle covering best practices of inheritance in C#. Specificially why this project violates Liskovâ€™s substitution principle.
